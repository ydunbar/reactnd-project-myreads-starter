# MyReads Project

This is a project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, and part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree. Starter code with static CSS and HTML markup was provided, and students were asked to refactor it into React code in order to complete the project.

## Getting Started

To install and run:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Backend Server

A backend server was provided to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains methods needed to perform necessary operations on the backend.

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
